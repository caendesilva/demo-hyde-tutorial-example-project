# Syntax Highlighting with Torchlight!


## ðŸ‘‡ This code is so lame, we need to do something about it 

```
<html>
	<h1 class="lead">
		No syntax highlighting? <strong>We can't have that.</strong>
	</h1>
</html>
```

## If only there was a free API for this we could use... Hooray for Torchlight!

```html
<html>
	<h1 class="lead">
		Torchlight? <strong>Yes, please.</strong>
	</h1>
</html>
```

And would you look at that, Hyde has automatically injected the attribution badge (which you can customize of course)!
